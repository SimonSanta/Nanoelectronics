Magnetoconductance oscillations in graphene antidot arrays, Sep 2018 â€“ Dec 2018

This project has been realised in the context of the Nanoelectronics course at UCLouvain (Belgium).

The subject of this paper, which is the study of magnetoconductance oscillation in graphene antidot arrays (an antidot array is simply a sheet of material periodically perforated), can be considered as a brick wall with respect to the end goal, a necessary step to further understand the properties and behaviour of tuned graphene in order to reach particular specification. To help modelizing the effect of the different parameters or geometrical shapes of the lattice on our magnetoconductance KWANT, a quantum effect simulator, will be used.

The project is realised using PYTHON and Kwant Libraries.
